## Data Analysis Summary

### Dataset Overview
- **Total Records Processed:** 18,127
- **Unique Parking Lots:** 14
- **Date Range:** 2016-10-04 to 2016-12-19
- **Features:** ID, SystemCodeNumber, Capacity, Latitude, Longitude, Occupancy, VehicleType, TrafficConditionNearby, QueueLength, IsSpecialDay, Timestamps

### Data Quality
- **Missing Values:** Handled through preprocessing
- **Invalid Records:** Removed occupancy > capacity cases
- - **Feature Engineering:** Created OccupancyRate, HourOfDay, DayOfWeek derived features

## Model Performance Comparison

### Model 1: Baseline Linear Pricing
**Formula:** `Price_t+1 = Price_t + Î± * (Occupancy/Capacity)`

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Average Price:** $19.11
- **Price Volatility (Std):** 2.26
- **Price Range:** $10.00 - $20.00

**Characteristics:**
- Simple, predictable pricing adjustments
- Low volatility, gradual price changes
- Suitable for stable market conditions

### Model 2: Demand-Based Pricing
**Formula:** `Demand = Î±*(Occupancy/Capacity) + Î²*QueueLength + Î³*Traffic + Î´*IsSpecialDay + Îµ*VehicleTypeWeight`
**Price Formula:** `Price_t = BasePrice * (1 + Î» * NormalizedDemand)`

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Average Price:** $13.91
- **Price Volatility (Std):** 1.14
- **Price Range:** $10.21 - $15.00

**Characteristics:**
- Multi-factor demand consideration
- Higher price sensitivity to market conditions
- More responsive to real-time changes

### Model 3: Competitive Pricing
**Strategy:** Location-based competitive analysis with proximity threshold

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Average Price:** $13.61
- **Price Volatility (Std):** 1.33
- **Price Range:** $10.49 - $15.75

**Characteristics:**
- Market-aware pricing strategies
- Geographic proximity considerations
- Dynamic competitive responses

## Business Recommendations

### 1. Peak Hour Pricing Strategy
- **Recommendation:** Implement 15-25% price increase during 12:00-14:00 hours
- **Rationale:** Demand analysis shows higher occupancy during lunch hours
- **Implementation:** Use demand-based model with time-of-day multipliers

### 2. Traffic-Based Dynamic Adjustments
- **Recommendation:** Increase prices by 15-25% during high traffic conditions
- **Rationale:** High traffic correlates with increased parking demand
- **Implementation:** Real-time traffic data integration

### 3. Competitive Monitoring System
- **Recommendation:** Monitor nearby parking lot prices for optimal positioning
- **Rationale:** Competitive pricing model shows market optimization potential
- **Implementation:** Geographic proximity analysis with 1km radius

### 4. Special Event Pricing
- **Recommendation:** Implement 30-50% price increase on special days/events
- **Rationale:** Special day factor shows significant demand impact
- **Implementation:** Event calendar integration

### 5. Vehicle Type Differentiation
- **Recommendation:** Implement tiered pricing based on vehicle type
- **Rationale:** Different vehicle types have different space and demand impacts
- **Implementation:** Vehicle type weight multipliers
